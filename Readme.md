Software Development Project
=============================

First and foremost, this is a work in progress. As I pursue the solution to this assignment, I will be following the lessons I learned in Software Development.
The steps I will take should go something like this:
 - Transform requirements into a use case diagram
 - Using the use case diagram, create a rough outline of the classes that will be needed to accomplish the uses.
 - Using these classes, I will create a sequence diagram for each use case in the diagram. This should give me a good idea of the functions needed in each class in order to complete the operations. It will also ensure that all operations are completed on the lowest levels possible.
 - I will use the functions outlined in the sequence diagrams to create a full class diagram, outlining every class and the methods and variables associated with them.
 - The Coding Begins! Using the class diagram, I can now implement the solution using coding.
 - As taught in the class, this implementation allows me to code a solution in any object oriented language I choose, and thus I am not limited until I absolutely have to be.

The assignment is to design a music sharing program designed to simulate lending music to friends and others.
The official assignment is in the folder, and will be formatted later for viewing in this readme.
